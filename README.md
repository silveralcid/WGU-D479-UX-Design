## Course Information

User Experience Design explores multiple tools and techniques used in user experience design. Students are presented with an in-depth view of activities involved in the design of user experience and have the opportunity to create several deliverables including persona profiles, information architectures, and prototypes of different levels of fidelity. In addition, the course also covers usability testing and the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative data derived from these and other experiments.


### Competencies

**Establishes Timeframes**

The learner establishes timeframes for user experience projects based on business requirements.

**Design Wireframes and Prototypes**

The learner designs application wireframes and prototypes using industry standard tools and techniques.

**Conducts Usability Testing**

The learner conducts formal and informal usability testing as part of application design prototyping.

**Updates Application Design**

The learner updates application designs based on user testing analysis results.

### Scenario

You have been contacted by the local government of the small island of Taniti. Since the island’s economy relies heavily on tourism, the Tanitian government has developed a plan to increase the number of tourists who visit the island and its attractions. As part of this plan, they have hired you to design a tourism website.

The Tanitian government has conducted a survey to gather information about current tourists. Their findings from this survey are shown in the “Survey Results” supporting document. The government has also provided you with the attached “About the Island” document to better inform you about Taniti and its visitors.

Taniti’s current website has an outdated look and feel. The page navigation is unclear. All the tourist information is jumbled together on a single page, and the site lacks booking information and links to each activity or option. The site is also not compatible with mobile devices.

The Tanitian government would like you to spend no more than one month designing a new website that will increase tourism on the island of Taniti and provide a welcoming experience for prospective tourists.

### Requirements

* Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project
* Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents
* Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website
* Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers
* Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing
